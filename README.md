How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I focus first on defining the purpose and experience I want to create. For this 3D graphics project, that meant imagining the scene’s layout,
lighting, and mood before writing a single line of code. I learned to sketch and plan models, textures, and camera angles to make sure each part supported the overall design.

What new design skills has this project helped me craft?
I developed stronger spatial thinking and learned how to balance visual appeal with performance efficiency. Managing lighting, camera positioning, and textures taught me how to design for both form and function.

What design process did I follow?
My process started with concept design, followed by building basic geometry, then refining details through testing and iteration. 
I used feedback from each milestone that I completed to refine both structure and lighting to make the scene more realistic. ANd worked with my mentor/tutor to bettr understand concepts and perspectives. 
I learned this is a course I heavily require hands on learning. An online enviornment was rather difficult for me.

How could these tactics apply in future work?
The same structured approach — planning, iterating, and refining — can apply to future projects in simulation, visualization, or even UI/UX design. It ensures creativity stays aligned with functionality.

How do I approach developing programs?
I approach programming by breaking complex problems into manageable components. For the 3D scene, I handled one element at a time; objects, lighting, textures and tested frequently to avoid compounding errors.

What new development strategies did I use?
I used modular coding, object-oriented principles, and iterative development to add complexity gradually. Working with shaders and transformations also taught me to debug visually, not just through code output.

How did iteration factor into development?
Iteration was essential. I often had to adjust lighting, camera angles, and material values multiple times before achieving a realistic result. Each test made the final version stronger.

How has my development approach evolved?
At first, I focused mainly on getting things to work. By the end, I focused more on design clarity and maintainability — making code structured, readable, and reusable.

How can computer science help me reach my goals?
Computer science gives me the tools to turn ideas into tangible systems. The balance between logic and creativity in this project reflects how technology can bring imagination to life.

How do computational graphics and visualization apply to my future?
These skills help me see how visuals can communicate data, design interfaces, or create simulations. Whether I work in engineering, research, or design, 
understanding computational graphics strengthens my ability to build interactive, engaging experiences if I were to ever consider this path for some odd reason.
